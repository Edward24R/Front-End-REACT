Informational page that summarizes the functionality of the Pakrwise system and showcases the development team via 
their own display cards. The page is composed of a background image, background blur, the Text Description, and the external
components. The OurCards component provides the development team's presentation in a concise and minimalistic manner, while the Footer 
component provides a visual element that balances the page layout.
